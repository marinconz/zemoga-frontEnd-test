# Zemoga UI-test
## Welcome to my implementation! :smile:
Hi! This is a guide on how to run the project and some details that are important to understand the implementation.
This project is the Zemoga UI test (front end), it is based on a provided template.
For this implemenation, the original template was adapted to ReactJS, and everything was separated into react components. 

## How to run the project :runner:
In order to see the whole project runing, the user has to: 
1.  Clone or download the repository 
2. Run the command `npm install` to install all the dependencies 
3. Run `npm start`, this will open the navigator and you will be able to see the project.

## About the voting system :heavy_check_mark: :x:

The voting system, or to be more specific, the votes, are stored in the LocalStorage of the browser.

## About the UI :framed_picture:

Due to time limitations I was able to develop the voting functionality as well as the grid and list views from desktop view.
**Note:** The pope's card nor the 'submit a name' element are functional, they were part of the template.

## About functionalities :gear:
* The top banner can be deleted by clicking on the 'X' at the right of the banner.
* The voting system works as indicated before, the user selects one of the votes (positive or negative) and to submit it they have to click on the Vote Now button. In order to submit another vote, the button that was last clicked (named 'Vote Now' before submit, now named 'Vote Again') has to be clicked again.
**Note:** This same behaviour can be replicated on the grid view.
* In order to change from List to Grid view, there is a select menu located at the top right corner of the card section.

## About responsiveness :left_right_arrow:

Eventhough I wasn't able to develop most of the responsive features, when the screen goes 'tighter' the hamburger menu appears, as well as the cards fitting their size to the tablet view.
**Note:** As previously mentioned, the mobile swipe card view wasn't implemented.
